TODO
- Introduce new variables to utility function
    - Add positive constant alpha (to local min calculation as well or only to saddle?)
    - include calculations in local min function

- Check values of beta 

- plotting function in main pipeline (plot_external_valence_equilibrium) plots saddle positions only

- check how strongly do you incline towards a party is used correctly (flipped values)
