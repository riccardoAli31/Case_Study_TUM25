TODO
- Implement opinion dynamics model

- Add arrows in axis labels of the plot (i.e. Democracy ---> Authoritarian-Democratic)
- Gaussian KDE with initial and equilibrium positions 

- Run the model for past years and compare results
    - beta_values list for each year 

- Remove old 2021 data and add the new source 2024 data

- Survey for students
- Cut the variables that we flip maybe
- Cut valence question from above because of encoding

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
- Run model for other countries
- Introduce new variables to utility function (u_ij = lambda_j - beta*||x_i-z_j||**2 + constant*sociodemographic_var + constant_2*external_valence)
    - sociodemographic variables
    - external valences
