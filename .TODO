TODO
- Finish up opinion dynamics model - experiments with coefficients

- Create a .py file for the opinion dynamics model to produce a new voter sample
- Create a .py file for the external valences equilibrium model

- Use the transformed voter sample to run equilbrium positions of parties

- Introduce new variables to utility function (u_ij = lambda_j - beta*||x_i-z_j||**2 + constant*sociodemographic_var + constant_2*external_valence)
    - sociodemographic variables
    - external valences
    
- Is it possible to account for the principles of the party rather than just maximizing votes?
